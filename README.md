## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- use direction:rtl to reverse input start
- use label to create a custom placeholder for inputs
- using br to achieve instead of flexbox to achieve multi-line design (refer to results --> valueArea in HTML)
- using preventDefault to force input to take actions only on certain characters
